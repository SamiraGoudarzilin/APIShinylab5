```
Introduction:

*This package includes a function that calls Kolada.se APIs of staff monthly salary between 2088 and 2021 .
Also there is a shiny App that creats a line graph which shows years on x axis and salary on y-axis.User can choos "F" as male, "k" as female and "T" as total number of male and female to see the line plot.*

```{r output of APP, echo=TRUE}
library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)

ui <- fluidPage(

    titlePanel("Monthly Salary according Gender Data"),
    sidebarLayout(
        sidebarPanel(
            selectInput("gen",
                        "select Gender:",
                        choices = c("K","M","T"),
                        selected = "K")
        ),

        mainPanel(
           plotOutput("line")
        )
    )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
 
      output$line <- renderPlot({
      #g <- reactive({input$gen}) don't use reactive for simple plots
      dataframe_plot <- koladaapi()
      genderplot=dataframe_plot[dataframe_plot$gender==input$gen,]
      year_axis=unique(dataframe_plot[["year"]])
      ggplot2::ggplot(genderplot, aes(x = year, y = value )) +  geom_line() +
      geom_point(size = 4, shape = 21, fill = "white") 
    })
}

# Run the application 
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
